This will come useful for the Municipality when perfoming some payment checks throughout the year. However, for the purposes of this simulation, we have decided to not include all the time contraints set in the smart contracts. In this way, we can indeed call all the functions without incurring in any problem. For example, we don't have to wait almost one year before being able to compute and pay the payouts to the citizens. "
