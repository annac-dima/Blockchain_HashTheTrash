- Disposal station? 
- how can information come from the outside world? E.g. when you throw trash bag in a bin, can information about serialNumberBin and 
  weight of the trash bag be collected automatically and then immediately used (there are sensors placed in bins)? -> ask professor
- event PickedUp -> how to deal with the situation when the collection of waste is not door by door and there could be more trash bags in
  the same bin (maybe even produced by different people?). Do we emit an event for each specific bag, or do we just emit a single event 
  like event PickedUp(uint id, uint serialNumberBin, bool isRecyclable, uint totWeight (tot weight of the trash in the bin, Merkle root
  of the addresses of people who have thrown trash bags in the bin)?;
- differentiate the types of recyclabe waste (e.g. plastic, paper, etc.)?
